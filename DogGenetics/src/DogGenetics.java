Ever heard of those places that you can mail in some of your dog’s hair, and they’ll send back a genetic analysis report to tell you what kind of dogs are in your most beloved pet’s ancestry?

Well, we don’t know how to do that. But we DO know how to generate random numbers. And half the time, that’s good enough. Especially for the Internet.

What You Should Do
Program Name: DogGenetics
Write a program that asks the user for the name of their dog, and then generates a fake DNA background report on the pet dog.
It should assign a random percentage using five dog breeds. The total percentage should be 100%.
